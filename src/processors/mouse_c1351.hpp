/**
 * @brief Emulation of the Commodore 1351 in proportional mode.
 * Uses the POTX and POTY pins to simulate analog values for the ADC inside
 * the SID.
 *
 * http://sensi.org/~svo/%5Bm%5Douse/ was a great help here
 *
 * The measurement cycle of the SID takes 512 microseconds.
 * The first 256 are spent inside the SID by draining a capacitor.
 * The second 256 are used to wait until the capacitor is charged to a certain
 * level by an external resistor. This means that the ADC is not measuring
 * voltage but resistance and it does this nearly linear which is good for
 * paddles.
 *
 * Our goal here is wait for a defined time and charge the capacitor in a timed
 * manner to simulate a certain value in the SID that we want.
 *
 * We does this by using the PIO units of the RP2040. One PIO has 4 state
 * machines. We will use all of them to drive 2x POTX and 2x POTY

     * This limits it to 2.25 which seems to be fine with "DESKTOP V1.0"
