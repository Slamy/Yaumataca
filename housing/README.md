# 3D printed case

## Version 1

A single M2 screw is used to keep everything together. Button is reachable via rather big hole.
SWD port is usable even if PCB is in case.

Problems:

* Thick fingers are unable to reach the button. This is only a small issue however as the button is used rarely.
* Screw at the bottom is sticking out if head is not very flat.
* Structural integrity not perfect.

## Version 2

Based on Version 1 but with changes:

* Big hole is replaced by smaller one and a small piece of plastic.
* Screw is moved to another location
* Bottom wall is thicker so screw head is not sticking out.
* Structural integrity still not perfect.
