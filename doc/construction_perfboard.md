## Overview

Use the photos as guidance.

It is encouraged to use a 2x5 pinheader instead of soldering the female d-sub connector to the board. It has a smaller footprint and ensures that both connectors will find their counterpart on the home computer as the distance will differ between the systems.

Especially with the Atari ST, there is not much room under the keyboard.
